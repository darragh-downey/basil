# Rust + Bazel Demo

I will attempt to demonstrate how to develop a shared Rust library in a monorepo.

We'll have a few build targets:

* Windows
* Mac Os
* Linux
* Svelte + Webassembly

Potentially I'll look into Android and as much as I would love to also build for iOs I believe I would have to hack Xcode to even get that to [work by myself...](https://youtu.be/NAPeWoimGx8?t=578)
